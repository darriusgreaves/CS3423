/*
You are running portsentry on your machine which detects probes at various ports
and will block the prober. You want a program which will report the attacks which oc-
cured after the last report. The last report was based on the file which is currently named
/var/log/ps.udp.1 while the current set of attacks (which includes the old attacks) is stored
in /var/log/ps.udp.0. Write a C program that will do a diff between these two files and
email root the results. This could be written on the command line as below (but donâ€™t).
diff /var/log/ps.udp.1 /var/log/ps.udp.0 | mail -s Attack root
